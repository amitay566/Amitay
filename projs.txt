Details about the projects

DeleteBackground - At the time, Wishi served as a public wardrobe platform that allowed users to match virtual outfits that they could apply to real life. Most of the clothes came from an existing image database, but there was an option for users to upload photos of their own clothing. During my time with the company, I initiated a project aimed at using a neural network to learn how to remove the background from an object in an image. To do this, I took the well-known image of the Webb satellite and divided it into many sections – in each section, I removed the stars and randomly generated different backgrounds with varying angles and shifts. The model learned from these inputs, and I attempted to adapt it to process clothing images. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the project as I left the company to focus more on my studies. Currently, I am in the process of completing it.

MCTS8 - An AI player that learns using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to solve the game of Chinese Checkers on a square board. It allows selecting different learning levels, and the code runs the winning moves in real time with varying difficulty levels. The game enables prediction of each player's win probability, the number of moves remaining, and includes an interactive gameplay feature built with the Turtle graphics library. The game is highly recommended.

Grover - As part of a university course, we were tasked with creating an algorithm capable of solving an n×2n matrix equation using Grover's algorithm, an efficient quantum search mechanism that operates in the square root of the time of classical search. To optimize the code, I developed a sophisticated quantum bit implementation using a tree graph structure or multi-variable tensor approach, which allowed me to implement logic gates without large matrices. The challenging part of the task was computing the matrix sums. While it could have been done classically, for the sake of challenge, I implemented it in a quantum manner and used a quantum calculator that pairs each state with a qubit to verify if it’s a solution.
